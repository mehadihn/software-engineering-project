## How To Run

### On the cloud

Simply visit our [codesandbox deployment](https://0nz1td-3000.csb.app/) and use [these](#credentials-to-use) credentials. 

### Locally

To run the code locally, youâ€™ll need to define your environment variables through the `.env.local` file or creating a `.env` file first. For a sample `.env` file, refer to `.env.example`. Use the same mongodb url (since it is set to the team mongodb instance url) and use your appropriate localhost url for the nextauth and host keys.

Once done, go to your console and run the following commands in the order specified.

This command will install all the prerequisite packages defined in the `package.json` file required to run the project.

```javascript

npm install 
```

This command will run the project in dev mode:

```javascript

npm run dev

```
